                <p>As a full stack web developer who's been programming since 2015, software development has become my
                    passion and creative outlet. My journey started on a whim, when I stumbled upon an introductory
                    programming class in high school. At the time, I didn't give it much thought, but the more I dove
                    into the world of coding, the more I discovered the joy and satisfaction of building something from
                    the
                    ground up that you could call your own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, ranging from web applications
                    to video games. Along the way, I've also had the honor of teaching programming at GSU and Tech
                    Corps, where I developed my keen focus on user experience and problem solving.

            <p>The intricacies of programming continue to fascinate me, and I've developed a passion for sharing my
                knowledge and enthusiasm with others. With the social skills I've honed as a tutor, teaching
                assistant, and instructor, I strive to inspire and motivate those around me to discover the fun and
                fulfillment of coding.</p>
